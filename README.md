# Exercise
Working in pairs:
Create a webpage that generates a celebration card.
- Make a starter test suite (you can add/update as you go along if needed)
- Add a form that asks for the following information
  - Greeting
  - Type of event (selected from a few)
  - Message
  - Submit button
- On submission, the form should be hidden and a card should be shown in place.


Stretch goals
- Use the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos) to pull in a background image based on the type of event.
